# VoltYield Platinum Rail: Fiduciary Core v1.0.0

### **Project Overview**
The VoltYield Platinum Rail is a **Private Fiduciary Ledger** engineered for the notarization and monetization of heavy-duty EV fleet assets. By integrating NIST-standard cryptography with real-time energy telemetry, the Rail captures expiring federal credits and activates high-margin carbon arbitrage.

### **Fiduciary Impact (2026 Strategy)**
* **Capital Capture:** $5.25 Billion (IRS 45W, 30C, 45Z).
* **Recurring Yield:** $295.5M / Year (V2G, SaaS Data, Asset Premium).
* **Carbon Arbitrage:** +742% Margin on Refined Credits.

### **Technical Sovereignty**
* **Security:** NIST FIPS 204 (ML-DSA) compliant SHA3-512 hashing.
* **Auditability:** Deterministic Immutable Logging (`fiduciary_audit.log`).
* **Infrastructure:** Zero-Trust Environment architecture with localized credential management.

### **Compliance Standards**
* **NIST SP 800-175B** (Cryptographic Standards)
* **ISO 26262** (Functional Safety)
* **SEC/IRS 2026 Reporting Requirements**
